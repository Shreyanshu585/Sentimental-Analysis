# Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

## Overview
This project involves building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for sentiment analysis. The model classifies the sentiment of a given text as either positive (1) or negative (0). This implementation uses state-of-the-art NLP techniques and tools to achieve high accuracy and scalability.

## Features
- Binary classification of sentiment (Positive: 1, Negative: 0)
- High accuracy using modern NLP frameworks
- Scalable and real-time text analysis
- Pretrained models like BERT for enhanced performance

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - NLTK
  - spaCy
  - Transformers (Hugging Face)
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shreyanshu585/Sentimental-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Sentimental-Analysis
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sentimental_analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess the data
   - Train the model
   - Test the model with sample inputs

## Dataset
The model is trained and evaluated using publicly available datasets, such as:
- IMDB Reviews Dataset
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset

## Results
- **Accuracy:** [Add your model's accuracy, e.g., 90%+]
- **Real-time Performance:** Capable of processing text in real-time for sentiment classification.

## Applications
- **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Understand user satisfaction.
- **Social Media Monitoring:** Analyze public opinion on trending topics.
- **Product Reviews:** Gain insights into customer sentiment.

## Future Scope
- Extend to multi-class sentiment analysis (e.g., Neutral sentiment).
- Add support for multiple languages.
- Integrate with a user-friendly web or mobile interface.
